# Project – Part II: Motivation

## Introduction
To address the health challenges of the city’s 50,000 employees, I propose a gamified wellness program called **“City Fit Quest”**, which aims to motivate employees to adopt healthier lifestyles through a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic motivators. This internal gamification initiative aligns with the institutional objective of reducing healthcare costs and improving employee well-being.

## System Overview
The system introduces a **point-based and level-up framework**, where employees earn points by completing health-related activities, such as:
- Walking or cycling to work
- Joining fitness classes
- Completing strength training
- Participating in nutrition workshops

Each activity has a clearly defined point value, and participants progress through levels such as:
- **Beginner**
- **Explorer**
- **Champion**
- **Wellness Leader**

### Features
- **Weekly and monthly missions or challenges** (e.g., “Complete 150 minutes of aerobic activity this week”) create short-term goals and structure.
- **Long-term goals** focus on sustainable habits and improvement.
- A **mobile or web-based platform** tracks individual and team progress, displays leaderboards (with opt-out privacy options), and celebrates achievements with digital badges and public recognition.

## Motivational Structure

### Intrinsic Motivation
- **Autonomy**: Employees choose their preferred activities, promoting a sense of control.
- **Competence**: Participants track improvements over time, set personal goals, and receive positive feedback.
- **Relatedness**: Team challenges and group activities build community and mutual support.
- **Recognition**: Spotlight stories and “health hero” profiles promote identity and self-expression.

### Extrinsic Motivation
- **Tangible rewards**: Fitness gear, extra vacation hours, health service discounts, or cafeteria vouchers at milestone levels.
- **Team rewards**: Departments with the highest participation or improvement foster friendly competition.
- **Health insurance benefits**: Integration with benefits (e.g., lower premiums for active participation) provides financial incentives tied to institutional goals.

## Justification
The program has the potential to save up to **$188 million annually**. A modest investment in technology (e.g., mobile platform, wearables integration, or badge cards for offline tracking) and incentive programs is justified. By combining immediate rewards with long-term intrinsic satisfaction, the system fosters engagement and builds a wellness culture across the city government.
